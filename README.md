After forking you can find it easy to follow these steps:

- Navigate to `/src/patches` directory.
- Create a file with the key name to write a `[content].js`-like code.
- To list your plugin, add a new field in `/src/config/patches.ts`.
- Specify what exactly your plugin is doing on which hostnames.
- Please make sure that the key of the field matches your filename.
- For message-based feature requests, create an issue.
